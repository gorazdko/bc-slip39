# [Blockchain Commons SLIP-39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39)

**Implementation of SLIP-39 Shamir Secret Sharing standard for use in [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com) Software Projects**

## Prerequisites

* If [`bc-crypto-base`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-crypto-base) is not installed, the `configure` step below will fail.
* If [`bc-shamir`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-shamir) is not installed, the `configure` step below will fail.

## Installation

```bash
$ ./configure
$ make check
$ sudo make install
```

This sequence runs the module's unit tests.

## Use

1. Link against `libbc-slip39.a`, `libbc-shamir.a` and `libbc-crypto-base.a`.
2. Include the umbrella header in your code:

```c
#include <bc-slip39/bc-slip39.h>
```

## Notes for Maintainers

Before accepting a PR that can affect build or unit tests, make sure the following sequence of commands succeeds:

```bash
$ ./configure
$ make distcheck
$ make distclean
```

`make distcheck` builds a distribution tarball, unpacks it, then configures, builds, and runs unit tests from it, then performs an install and uninstall from a non-system directory and makes sure the uninstall leaves it clean. `make distclean` removes all known byproduct files, and unless you've added files of your own, should leave the directory in a state that could be tarballed for distribution. After a `make distclean` you'll have to run `./configure` again.

### Used with…

These are other projects that work with or leverage `$projectname`:

- [community/repo-name/](https://github.com/community/repo-name) — Repo that does what, by [developer](https://github.com/developer)  or from  [community](https://community.com).

### Derived from…

This  `$projectname` project is either derived from or was inspired by:

- [community/repo-name/](https://github.com/community/repo-name) — Repo that does what, by [developer](https://github.com/developer)  or from  [community](https://community.com).

### Dependencies

To build the  `$projectname` you'll need to use the following tools:

- autotools - Gnu Build System from Free Software Foundation ([intro](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html)).

### Known Issues

#### ⚠️ Warning: Lack of Round-trip Compatibility between BIP-39 and SLIP-39

At first glance, BIP-39 and SLIP-39 both appear to be means of converting a binary seed to a set of backup words and back. You might assume you could simply convert a BIP-39 backup to a binary seed, from that binary seed to SLIP-39, and then use the SLIP-39 backup to recover the same wallet as the original BIP-39 backup, but this is **NOT** the case. This is because the SLIP-39 algorithm that SatoshiLabs uses in their Trezor wallet does not derive the master secret in the same way as their BIP-39 algorithm does.

Currently Blockchain Commons is investigating an alternative to SLIP-39 that allows round-trips with BIP-39. We want to ensure that the same seed will result in the same derived keys using either BIP-39 or our alternative approach.

As SLIP-39 is not round-trip compatible with BIP-39, and SLIP-39 is under the control of SatoshiLabs and does not appear to be a fully community-controlled standard, Blockchain Commons is no longer endorsing SLIP-39.
